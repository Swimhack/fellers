### 🔄 **Automatic Deployment Process**

**Triggers:**
- ✅ Push to main branch → Production deployment
- ✅ Pull request → Deploy preview
- ✅ Branch push → Branch deployment

**Process:**
1. Netlify detects GitHub push
2. Pulls latest code from repository
3. Installs dependencies (`npm install`)
4. Runs build command (`npm run build`)
5. Publishes `dist` folder contents
6. Applies redirects and headers from `netlify.toml`
7. Site goes live automatically

### 🛡️ **Security & Performance**

**Security Headers:** ✅ Configured
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

**Caching Strategy:** ✅ Optimized
- Static assets: 1 year cache
- Images: 1 year cache
- HTML: No cache (for SPA updates)

**Performance:** ✅ Optimized
- CSS/JS bundling and minification
- Asset compression
- Lighthouse plugin for monitoring

### 🚨 **Important Notes**

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - Must be set in Netlify Dashboard, not in code
   - Supabase keys are required for database functionality
   - Resend API key needed for contact form emails

2. **Admin Access:**
   - Credentials: `admin` / `fellers123`
   - Works without environment variables (hardcoded)
   - Session expires after 24 hours

3. **Contact Form:**
   - Saves to Supabase database (requires VITE_SUPABASE_URL/KEY)
   - Sends emails via Resend (requires RESEND_API_KEY)
   - Falls back gracefully if services unavailable

4. **Gallery Images:**
   - Admin can upload via bulk upload interface
   - Images stored in localStorage (client-side)
   - 3 random images shown in "Our Customers" section
